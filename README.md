To get everything to display correctly, you must do the following steps in the order below, otherwise it will break

Before adding any trees or heat islands to the map, you must place a point on the map using the Sketch Widget in the bottom right. Only the first point you make with this will do anything

Add the heat islands to the map by clicking the Query Area button in the top left

Add the trees to the map by clicking the Add Trees button in the top left

Open the console and wait for it to stop outputing, once it stops then all the data is loaded

You can probably start editing before it is done, but the heat island data will still be getting updated from the existing trees at the same time



Use the Select tool in the Editor Widget to move trees

Use the New Feature tool with the tree symbol next to it to create new tree features

Do not use the New Feature tool with the circle next to it

Changing the Tree Type also changes the radius that the heat islands are impacted and the starting cooling temperature

The Submit Changes button does nothing
