If prompted to sign in, you can sign in with your eagle labs account

Before adding any trees or heat islands to the map, you must place a point on the map using the Sketch Widget in the bottom right

Add the heat islands to the map by clicking the Query Area button in the top left

Add the trees to the map by clicking the Add Trees button in the top left

The heat islands and trees will be added in the radius up to 100m surrounding the latest point added with the sketch tool

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the Select tool in the Editor Widget to move trees

Use the New Feature tool with the tree symbol next to it to create new tree features

Do not use the New Feature tool with the circle next to it

Changing the Tree Type also changes the radius that the heat islands are impacted and the starting cooling temperature (this is only working for White Poplar and Eucalyptus trees)

The Submit Changes button does nothing
