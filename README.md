If prompted to sign in, you can sign in with your eagle labs account

To get everything to display correctly, you must do the following steps in the order below, otherwise it will break

Before adding any trees or heat islands to the map, you must place a point on the map using the Sketch Widget in the bottom right. Only the first point you make with this will do anything

Add the heat islands to the map by clicking the Query Area button in the top left

Add the trees to the map by clicking the Add Trees button in the top left

You may have to wait up to about 10 seconds after the trees appear for the heat island data to update for the existing trees. New trees will be faster

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the Select tool in the Editor Widget to move trees

Use the New Feature tool with the tree symbol next to it to create new tree features

Do not use the New Feature tool with the circle next to it

Changing the Tree Type also changes the radius that the heat islands are impacted and the starting cooling temperature (although I think this might not be working properly, not important for demo though)

The Submit Changes button does nothing
